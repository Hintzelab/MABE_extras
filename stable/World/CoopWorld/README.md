CoopWorld

Initally this world was designed to ask questions related to hyena group hunting stratagies.
It has morphed more into a more general game theory system.
In CoopWorld agents exist at fixed locations on a grid. Each agent must choose on each
update to group hunt, solo hunt, or take no action. Parameters allow the user to set the
group size and the number agents in a group that must group hunt in order to succeede.
As described in the world cfg file, users can set the payoffs for each action. Agents live
between a min to max duration (set in config).

This world can generate intereting evolutionary and ecological dynamics.
